      <h3>How Outcome is governed</h3>

      <p>
        We combine Mandate, enforceable policy packs, the Max Outcome Decision Engine,
        and the Value Surface to achieve maximum outcome within explicit boundaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Policy packs define how AI is allowed to operate. Examples include Baseline AI,
        Enterprise AI to Contact (B2B/B2C), Autonomous, Regulated, and Experimental AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Autonomous AI without governance is already restricted worldwide and becoming
        increasingly regulated. Mandate ensures AI acts only within law, policy,
        and responsibility — by design, not by exception.
