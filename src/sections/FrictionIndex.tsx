      <h3>Friction Index</h3>

      <p>
        The Friction Index shows where governance is blocking value
        or exposing risk — and where policy changes can improve outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three neutral indicators represent relative friction for
        ALLOW, WAIT, and BLOCK.
      </p>

      <p>
        Month-on-Month improvement indicates increasing success
        with lower accumulated risk (e.g. 12%+).
      </p>

      <p>
        Improve revenue by adjusting governance — not by increasing activity.
