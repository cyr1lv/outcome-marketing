      <h2>The Missing Link for AI</h2>

      <p>
        Outcome Infrastructure consists of four core components:
        <br />
        Mandate · Max Outcome Decision Engine · Friction Index · Value Surface
      </p>

      <p>We are the law for AI — and within the law, we maximize outcome.</p>

      <p>
        Not because we make laws — but because without explicit rules, AI has no law at
        all.
      </p>

      <p>
        People and organizations operate within legislation, policy, and responsibility.
        AI agents do not do this by default. AI optimizes for volume unless you explicitly
        define what is allowed — and what is never allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI is entering a regulated era. Frameworks such as the EU AI Act, GDPR, SOC 2,
        and sector-specific regulations now explicitly require control, accountability,
        and auditability.
      </p>

      <p>These regulations require systems to decide responsibly before acting.</p>

      <p>Outcome Infrastructure is built for this reality.</p>
