      <h2>Mandate</h2>

      <p>
        Mandate translates legislation, policy, and risk into enforceable rules
        for AI. Within those boundaries, we let AI perform at its best. Outside
        those boundaries, we do not allow it to act.

      <h2>Max Outcome Decision Engine</h2>

      <p>
        The Max Outcome Decision Engine determines when AI should act —
        optimizing for probability, value, and timing, while subtracting risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Max Outcome = probability × value × timing − risk</strong>
